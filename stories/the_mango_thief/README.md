# The Mango Thief
In a small village in India, under the shade of a giant mango tree, lived a kind old farmer named Dadaji. Every summer, his mango tree would be full of sweet, golden mangoes. The village children loved playing near it, waiting for the mangoes to ripen.

One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, Dadaji noticed something strange. Some mangoes were missing! "Who could be taking my mangoes?" he wondered. He decided to stay awake and catch the thief.

That night, he hid behind the tree. After a while, he heard a rustling sound. A small shadow climbed up the tree. "Got you!" Dadaji said, lighting his lantern. To his surprise, it was little Chintu, the mischievous boy from the village.

Chintu looked down, scared. "I'm sorry, Dadaji," he said. "My mother is sick, and I wanted to bring her something sweet."

Dadaji's heart melted. Instead of scolding Chintu, he smiled and said, "If you had asked, I would have given you as many mangoes as you wanted." He picked the ripest mangoes and handed them to Chintu.

From that day on, Dadaji let the village children pick mangoes whenever they wanted. And Chintu? He never stole again. He learned that kindness and honesty are always the best choices.
