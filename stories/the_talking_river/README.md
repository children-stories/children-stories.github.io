# Meena and the Talking River

In a small village in India, little Meena loved playing by the river near her home. Every morning, she sat on the smooth rocks, splashing water and humming songs.

One day, as she dipped her feet into the water, she heard a soft voice say, **Hello, Meena!**

She looked around, surprised. **Who's there?** she asked.

**It's me, the river!** the voice giggled.

Meena's eyes widened. **You can talk?**

**Only to kind children like you,** said the river. **Since you take care of me and never throw waste in my water, I have a gift for you.**

Just then, a beautiful golden fish jumped out of the river and landed in Meena's hands. **This fish will bring happiness to your family. Take good care of it.**

Meena gently took the fish home and placed it in a small pond. From that day, her home was always filled with joy and laughter.

And every time Meena visited the river, it whispered secrets only she could hear.
