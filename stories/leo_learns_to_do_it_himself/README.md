# Leo the Little Lion Learns to Do Things!

Leo the little lion lived in the big, bright jungle with his family. He loved to run, jump, and play, but there was one thing he wanted most—to do things all by himself!

One morning, Leo woke up and stretched his paws. "I'm a big lion now! I can do things on my own!" he roared.

First, he tried to put on his shoes. It was tricky! One shoe was upside down, and the other was on the wrong foot. But Leo kept trying. "I can do it!" he said. And after a few tries—he did it!

Next, Leo wanted to pour his own water. He carefully held the cup and tipped the pitcher. Uh-oh! A little spilled, but that was okay! "I'll try again," said Leo. This time, he did it just right!

Later, Leo's tummy rumbled. "Time for a snack!" He grabbed a banana and peeled it all by himself. Yum!

At bedtime, Leo brushed his teeth with a big, bubbly smile. "I did so many things today!" he cheered.

Mama Lion hugged him and said, "I'm so proud of you, Leo! You are learning to do things all by yourself!"

Leo curled up, feeling happy and proud. He couldn't wait to try more things tomorrow!
