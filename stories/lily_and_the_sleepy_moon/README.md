# Lily and the Sleepy Moon

Lily was a little bunny who loved to play all day in the green meadows. She ran, hopped, and laughed with her friends, but when the sun began to set, she didn't want to sleep. "Just a little longer!" she would say, chasing fireflies. One evening, the big, round moon whispered, "Little one, even the stars need rest. Close your eyes, and I'll shine softly until morning."

Lily thought about the moon's gentle words. If the stars and moon rested, then maybe she should too. She curled up in her cozy bed of soft hay, feeling warm and safe. As she closed her eyes, she listened to the night breeze singing a lullaby, and soon, she drifted into sweet dreams of fluffy clouds and twinkling stars.

When morning arrived, Lily felt happy and full of energy. "Sleeping early makes my day even brighter!" she told her friends. From that night on, Lily always listened to the moon, knowing that good rest helped her hop even higher the next day.
