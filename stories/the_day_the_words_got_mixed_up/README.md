# The Day the Words got Mixed-up

Characters: Leo the Lion Cub, Mama Lion, and Teacher Owl

Leo was a happy little lion cub. He loved running, jumping, and playing.
But sometimes… when things didn’t go his way, his feelings got really big.

One morning at school, Leo was building a tall block tower.
Just when he was about to put the last block, Teacher Owl said:

“Leo, it’s time to clean up.”

Leo didn’t want to clean up.
His tummy got tight. His face got hot. His feelings felt too big.

And suddenly his words got mixed up!

Instead of saying,

“I’m upset!”
Leo shouted,
“BAD TEACHER!”

The classroom got very quiet.

Teacher Owl didn’t get angry. She stayed very calm and said:

“Leo, I think you’re feeling upset.
It’s okay to feel upset.
But calling people bad hurts their hearts.
Next time, you can say: I’m upset. I need help.”

Leo didn’t say anything, but his ears drooped. He felt bad inside.

After school, he told Mama Lion what happened.
Mama Lion gave him a warm hug and said:

“Feelings can get big sometimes.
You are not a bad lion.
You are a learning lion.”

Then she whispered a secret:

“When angry words want to jump out of your mouth,
take a deep lion breath and say the magic words:
**I’m upset. I need help.**”

Leo practiced with Mama — big lion breath, then calm magic words.

The next day, Leo was coloring at school.
He was making a beautiful rainbow when Teacher Owl said:

“Leo, it’s time to line up.”

Leo felt his tummy tighten again.
The angry words tried to jump out:
“BAD—!”
But he stopped.

He remembered Mama’s lion breath.
He took a deep breath… Roooooar… and said:

“**I’m upset. I need a minute.**”

Teacher Owl smiled.
“You used calm words! When you’re ready, you can join us.”

**Leo felt proud — bigger and braver than any roar.**

That evening, Leo told Mama Lion what happened.
Mama Lion kissed his head and said:

“You used your strong words, not your hurt words.
That’s what brave lions do.”

Leo curled up happily, thinking,
Feelings can be big… and I can still be kind.
