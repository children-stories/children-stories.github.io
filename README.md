## The Magic Mango Tree
In a small Indian village, a kind-hearted boy named Rohan lived with his grandmother. One summer, a terrible drought hit the village, and food became scarce. One day, while walking in the forest, Rohan found a small mango tree with a single golden mango hanging from its branches.

As he reached for it, the tree spoke, “If you take my mango and share it, I will give you more.” Rohan was surprised but nodded. He took the mango home and shared it with everyone in the village.

The next morning, the tree was full of golden mangoes! The villagers happily took the mangoes and never went hungry again. But a greedy man tried to take all the mangoes for himself. The tree shook and disappeared into the sky, never to be seen again.

**Moral:** Sharing brings abundance, but greed leads to loss.
